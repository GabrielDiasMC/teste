1 HTTP Module:

Can lauch a server or send requests to another server.

1.2 HTTPS 

Can launch an server with enconded data.



        1.2.1 HTTP Introduction - Ethan Brown. 

        HTTP protocol defines a collection of request methods ( http verbs) that client uses to communicate with a server. GET and POST are the common methods.

        When a cliente type a URL into a browser or click a link, the browser issues an HTTP GET request to the server.

        What is passed by the HTTP to the server is the URL path and querystring. The querystring is defined in URL section above.

        The combination of method, path, querystring is what your app uses to determinate how to respond.

        Th server can repons with HTML documents and several other types, such as images, css scripts and files.

        POST request are usually reserved for sending information back to the server.

        Every time we are in web site, our browser send hidden information to the server in the form o request HEADER ! 



            - Methods

            Get : retrive (fetch) data from the server, such as a HTLM File, CSS, JSON or XML Data.
            POST Submit data to the server, such as a contact form.
            PUT: Update Date
            DELETE: Delete data from the server

            OBS: IN CHROME BROWSER ONE CAN ONPEN DEVELOPERS TOOLS AN CHECK OUT IN NETWORK TAB ALL THE REQUEST MADE FROM OUR BROWSER TO THE SERVER.
            for each document requested we can see the HEADERS (GENERAL, REQUEST, RESPONSE) ; PREVIEW, REPONSE, INITIATOR AND TIMING.

            In the HEADERS, we find out the the object and metadata of the http request, as well the response metadata from the server.

            https://www.postman.com/

    


        HTTP is a client-side protocol to fetch resousrce such as HTML documents from the server therefore a http request is made by a client-browser.

        The request made form the browser fetches sub.documents to build-up a complete wed-document made up of:

                Sub-documents 

                    css for layout
                    png for image
                    hmtl for pages
                    mp4 for videos
                    jpg for adds.
                    js for scripts


            To make the request, the client uses the URL (Uniform Resource Location)
            The URL locates a resource that exist on internet.
            URL are mostly used when a client make a http request to a Server. 

            Between the client request and the server resposnse, there are several entities named proxies.

            To display a web-page:

                Client makes a http resquet - server responds with a html document - Cliet fetches the html document - The html document is parsed
                and therefore new solicitations are made to execute js scripts, css layout information and subfiles such jpgs and mp4 -
                The web browser combines the different documents and requested resources to display the wbe document.
                The web page is also a hyprtext document. It means it can have links (butons) to fetch another pages. The browser interprets
                the directions as new https requests


            Https is a necrypted version of HTTP
                
            Proxies: 
                caching
                filtering
                load balacing - Allow different servers to handle multiple request.
                authentication - to control access to different controls.
                logging - storage of historical information 


                - URL

                Is a string the locates a web document.

                The componentes for a URL and its syntax


                    scheme: the protocol to access the content from the internet (https out https)
                    host: the name indentifier of the host the holds the resource.
                    path: identifies the specific content the client wants to access. 
                    fragment_identifier: followed by a hash #. It points the web browser to a function to the intem retrieved. its commonly used to indicate sunsection in a page.
                
                    example: notion kanban boards are subsections indicated with the fragment identifier of the web documnt url. 


                    scheme://host:port/path?query

        Req is an object with dozens of properties. The most commonly used for programmers are the metada from the headers, method and URL properties.

        This function makes the implemented server to listen on a specif port of the server machine). It creates a listener in a port. 
        Every time a request comes from the browser or another server, the line code inside the callbackfunction of http.createServer is executed. 
        Implictly, the callback function of http.createServer is invoked after event.listen catches a request. Therefore, there is a asynchronous computation.


        Routing 

        Refers to the mechanism for serving the client with the content it has asked. The content is specified with the URL (path * querystring)
        Therefore a input button in HTML document might update the client URL with a new path and query string, and a new request with a proper method, routing the client.

        1.3.1 The Event Loop

        The aforementioned code launched a server. This programm was not haulted because an EVENT LOOP was created by a LISTENING EVENT.
        The event loop is fundamental as node.js is single threaded. 
        The event loop is a feature of node.js, abstracted as a loop of event handlings that the compiler provides to handle synchrnous and asynchrnous programming as weel
        I/O calls of the same thread.
        The event loops makes the code avaiable, but only runnable when there is a proper request from the browser or from another server.
        One can unregister the event lop with a method inherited from the Process.Prototype, process.exit().

                NPM access packages from its own cloud repository.

                - PACKAGES FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PACKAGES FOR RUNNING APLICATIONS

                Several packages only provide value during development time. When the application is deployed, they are not used anymore.
                Thats the case of nomemon, for example. It is a facility only for development. 
                Thats the difference between production dependency and development dependency

                Syntax 

                npm install nodemon --save--dev (Development dependecy for working code)
                npm install nodemon -g (Install globaly and used every where - Rare)
                sudo npm install nodemon -g (Mac - Rare)
                npm install nodemon -- save (Production Dependency)
                npm install nodemon (Local dependecy)
               

                One we run the instalation promtp, a folder named node-modules was created in the directory of the module, containing nodemon scripts and other 34 packages that nodemon is dependent.
                We can delete this folder, and just reinstanll all them qhen needed using npm install again because the dependencies are register in package.json
                npm install execute the instalation of all dependencies listed in package.json 

                Global dependencies can be run directly from the terminal
                Dev and Production can only be run through npm scripts.

                added 33 packages, and audited 34 packages in 2s ( Console)

                If you want to run a package only instanlled localy, you can not execute it derecty from the terminal line (nodemon server.js)
                We can do that with npm because it is globally installed.
