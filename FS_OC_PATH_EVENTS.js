/* Chapter 10 - Modules Flanagan

Modular porgramming are suitable for large programms to be assembled using modules of code from disparte authors and sources.
It allows all the code to tun correctly even in presence of posteriously added modules to the programm.
Modularity allows encapsulation and hiding PRIVATE IMPLEMENTATIO DETAILS.

Each file in node.js is treated as a MODULE.

Until recently, JS had no built-in modulatiry.

Therefore, modularities ere largely provided with the deploymente of closures, objects and classes.

CLOSURE-BASED MODULARITY was made with code-bundling tools, using the function require ()

require() based modules are fundamenal in node.js

The keywords Export and import were implemented only recently. 

There are, therefore, three methodologies to work with modues: classes, objects and clodures ; require() in node.js and ES6 modules using export, import and import()



 - GeeksforGeeks

require() is global fuction. Whe it is invoked there is a sequence of triggered steps.

Resolving and Loading - Node.js resolvers if the module is third-part module , developer module, or a built-in core module.
Wrapping - The code of the module is wrapped in a special function to be executed. Therefore, every imported module is entirely executed.
Execution - Execute the code of the imported module
return exports - values stores in module.exports as objects, or properties of export.properties are returned. 
chaching - at the first time a module is loaded, they are cached. Therefore, the execution of the wrapped code is done only once.

    10.2 Modules in Node

    Differently of the browsers that works and slow networks, Node.js gains no benefits in bundling a Node program into a single javascript file.

    Each MODULe in Node.js are independent and have private namespaces. Constant, Variables, Functions and Classes defined in one file are PRIVARE
    UNLESS YOU EXPORT THEM AND THE VALUES EXPORTED FROM ONE MODULE ARE ONLY VISIBLE IN ANOTHER MODULE IF THAT MODULE EXPLICTLY IMPORTS THEM.


    In Node.js, the require() function import modules. A module, although, export it public API setting properties of the Exports Object or by replacing module.export object entirely.


    10.2.1 Node Exports.
    
    Each file in Node.js has an object known as exports. If you want to export a value from it, you can assign to them as properties fo the export object. */

    exports.property = //   a unique functions / classes / closures / objects. 

    module.exports.property = // an object containing exportable obkects {functions / classes} etc

    /* One can pass all the functions, classes and objects to a single object and export it. 
    It is rather common to define the exports object at the end of the module
    */

    module.exports = {/* function, classes, objects*/}

        // Multiple Exportation: When a module export various objects, rathern than one; 

    /*

    10.2.2 Node Imports

    Node imports another module by calling the require()

    The argument is the name of the module to be imported.

    Two ways of importing:

        If is a a library or a Module you instaled, use the unqualified name of the module that will atuomatically turn into a file path. */

         const fs = require("fs");

         const http = require("http")

        // If it is a code of your own, the module name should be the path to the file that contains that code relative to the current modules file. 

        const o = require("/. Advanced/Data Strucutes/Hash.js") // Importing the class HashTable from another module.

//      From "/. Advanced/Data Strucutes/Hash.js:


            exports.hash = class Hash {/* implementation omitted*/}
